# Sample Syllabus
## Course Description
This course, Introduction to Deep Learning with Python (DS311), introduces students to deep learning concepts, architectures, and libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks, which are modeled after the human brain's structure and function. In this course, students will learn how to build and train neural networks for various applications.

## Corequisites
- DA310: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
- DA320: Data Science Project

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the principles and concepts of deep learning.
- Implement neural networks using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Train and evaluate deep learning models.
- Apply deep learning techniques to real-world problems.

## Course Structure
The course content will be presented through a series of lectures, hands-on workshops, and projects. Students will be evaluated through assignments, a final exam, and a data science project.

### Assignments
Throughout the semester, students will be given assignments that will require them to implement and evaluate deep learning models using TensorFlow and PyTorch. These assignments will allow students to practice their deep learning skills.

### Final Exam
At the end of the semester, students will take a final exam that will cover all the material presented in the lectures. The final exam will prioritize the understanding and application of deep learning concepts and techniques. The exam will count towards a significant portion of the overall course grade.
