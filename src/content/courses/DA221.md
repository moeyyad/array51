# Sample Syllabus
## Course Description
This course, Probability and Statistics for Data Analytics (DS221), focuses on probability theory, descriptive and inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. These topics are essential for understanding and interpreting data in various domains. Probability and statistics provide the foundation for data analytics and are used to make informed decisions based on data.

## Prerequisites
- DA120: Discrete Mathematics for Programming

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the principles of probability theory.
- Apply descriptive and inferential statistical methods to analyze data.
- Perform hypothesis testing to make statistical inferences.
- Use regression analysis to model relationships between variables.

## Course Structure
The course content will be presented through a series of lectures and practical exercises. Students will be evaluated through assignments and a final exam.

### Assignments
Throughout the semester, students will be given assignments that will require them to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the lectures to analyze real-world data. These assignments will allow students to practice their statistical analysis skills and will count towards the overall course grade.

### Final Exam
At the end of the semester, students will take a final exam that will cover all the material presented in the lectures. The final exam will prioritize the understanding and application of probability and statistics concepts. The exam will count towards a significant portion of the overall course grade.
