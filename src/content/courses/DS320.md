# Sample Syllabus
## Course Description
This course, Mathematics for Machine Learning (DS320), covers essential mathematical concepts for machine learning, including linear algebra, calculus, optimization, and probability theory. Mathematics forms the foundation of machine learning algorithms and techniques, and a solid understanding of these concepts is crucial for developing and understanding machine learning models.

## Prerequisites
- DA221: Probability and Statistics for Data Analytics

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply linear algebra concepts to machine learning.
- Use calculus to understand and develop machine learning algorithms.
- Apply optimization techniques to machine learning problems.
- Understand and apply probability theory to machine learning.

## Course Structure
The course content will be presented through a series of lectures, tutorials, and problem-solving sessions. Students will be evaluated through assignments, quizzes, and a final exam.

### Assignments
Throughout the semester, students will be given assignments that will require them to apply mathematical concepts to solve machine learning problems. These assignments will allow students to practice their mathematical skills in the context of machine learning.

### Final Exam
At the end of the semester, students will take a final exam that will cover all the material presented in the lectures. The final exam will test students' understanding and application of mathematical concepts in the context of machine learning. The exam will count towards a significant portion of the overall course grade.
