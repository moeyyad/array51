# Sample Syllabus
## Course Description
This course, Introduction to Database Programming with SQL (DA111), covers the fundamentals of relational databases and SQL (Structured Query Language). Relational databases are widely used in various industries to store and manage data. SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. In this course, students will learn how to create, manipulate, and query databases using SQL.

The course will cover topics such as database design and writing SQL statements for data manipulation and retrieval. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises, students will gain practical experience in working with databases and SQL.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of relational databases.
- Design and create databases using SQL.
- Manipulate data in databases using SQL.
- Write complex SQL queries to retrieve data from databases.

## Course Structure
The course content will be presented through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises. Students will be evaluated through weekly quizzes, four assignments, and a final exam.

### Weekly Quizzes
Each week, students will be given a quiz to test their understanding of the material covered in the lectures. These quizzes will be short and will count towards a small percentage of the overall course grade.

### Assignments
Throughout the semester, students will be given four assignments that will require them to design databases and write SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data. These assignments will be more comprehensive than the weekly quizzes and will count towards a larger percentage of the overall course grade.

### Final Exam
At the end of the semester, students will be given a final exam that will cover all the material presented in the lectures. This exam will count towards a significant percentage of the overall course grade.
