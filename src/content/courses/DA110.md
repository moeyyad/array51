# Sample Syllabus
## Course Description
This course, Introduction to Programming with Python (DA110), is designed to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to programming using the Python programming language. Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language that is used in a variety of fields, and is of special relevance to data analytics. In this course, students will learn the basics of Python syntax, data structures, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming.

The course will emphasize problem-solving skills and developing practical programming applications. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of programming with Python and will be able to apply their knowledge to solve a variety of programming problems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the basics of Python syntax.
- Use data structures in Python, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- Implement control flow in Python, including loops and conditional statements.
- Define and use functions in Python.
- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming and implement classes and objects in Python.
- Solve practical programming problems using Python.

## Course Structure
The course content will be presented through a series of lectures and programming exercises. Students will be evaluated through weekly quizzes, four assignments, and a final exam.

### Weekly Quizzes
Each week, students will be given a quiz to test their understanding of the material covered in the lectures. These quizzes will be short and will count towards a small percentage of the overall course grade.

### Assignments
Throughout the semester, students will be given four assignments that will require them to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the lectures to solve programming problems. These assignments will be more comprehensive than the weekly quizzes and will count towards a larger percentage of the overall course grade.

### Final Exam
At the end of the semester, students will be given a final exam that will cover all the material presented in the lectures. This exam will count towards a significant percentage of the overall course grade.
