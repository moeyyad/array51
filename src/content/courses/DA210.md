# Sample Syllabus
## Course Description
This course, Introduction to Data Analysis with Python (DA210), will introduce students to Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Python is a popular programming language for data analysis due to its simplicity and the powerful libraries available for data manipulation and analysis. In this course, students will learn how to use these libraries to extract insights from complex datasets through a programmatic approach.

## Prerequisites
- DA110: Introduction to Programming with Python
- DA111: Introduction to Database Programming with SQL

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Use Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
- Perform data analysis tasks using Python.
- Visualize data using Matplotlib.
- Extract insights from complex datasets using a programmatic approach.

## Course Structure
The course content will be presented through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises. Students will be evaluated through assignments and a final project.

### Assignments
Throughout the semester, students will be given assignments that will require them to perform data analysis tasks using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. These assignments will allow students to practice their data analysis skills and will count towards the overall course grade.

### Final Project
At the end of the semester, students will complete a final project where they will have to perform a comprehensive data analysis using Python. This project will serve as a culmination of the skills learned throughout the course and will count towards a significant portion of the overall course grade.
