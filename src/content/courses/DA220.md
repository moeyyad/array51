# Sample Syllabus
## Course Description
This course, Data Structures and Algorithms (DA220), introduces fundamental data structures and algorithms and their applications in data analysis and problem-solving. Data structures and algorithms are essential concepts in computer science and are used to organize and manipulate data efficiently. In this course, students will learn about various data structures such as lists, trees, and graphs, as well as sorting and searching algorithms.

## Prerequisites
- DA120: Discrete Mathematics for Programming

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand fundamental data structures such as lists, trees, and graphs.
- Implement basic data structures and algorithms in Python.
- Analyze the efficiency of algorithms using Big O notation.
- Apply data structures and algorithms to solve data analysis and problem-solving tasks.

## Course Structure
The course content will be presented through a series of lectures and bi-weekly assignments. Students will be evaluated through assignments and a final exam.

### Assignments
Throughout the semester, students will be given assignments that will require them to implement and analyze various data structures and algorithms. These assignments will allow students to practice their problem-solving skills and will count towards the overall course grade.

### Final Exam
At the end of the semester, students will complete a final exam based on the course material as presented in the lectures.
